Data and  R code to conduct the statistics and create the figures in:

A synchronous surround increases the motion strength gain of motion.

1. Install the packages that are loaded in the first lines of 'functions.R'.
2. Run 'functions.R' that  contains the functions that I used. 
3. Run 'analysis.R'. The figures will be created in the folder library. It might
take about one hour.


Computing time. 

To compute the bootstrap samples for the conjoint fit might take more than one day. 
For that reason, 'analysis.R' reads 'fitAllBoot.txt' that contains already 1000 samples. 
To generate the bootstrap samples from scratch you need to execute 
'bootstrapForConjointFit.R'
